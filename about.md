On the ICR Light Microscopy Facility website you can find news about microscopy traning organized in the facility. We also aim at sharing the project developed in the facility, so that you can find inspiration when you plan your next imaging experiment.

On our GitHub page we are sharing commonly used image analysis pipelines that can provide help for ICR users in particular, but also for the scientific community in general.

If you have specific questions or content that you would like to add on this page, please get in touch with <kai.betteridge[at]]icr.ac.uk> or ,<ana.stojiljkovic[at].icr.ac.uk>.
